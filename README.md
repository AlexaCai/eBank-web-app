## Project description

*All names and information are fictive and for demonstration purpose only.

This web app was created to simulate a banking application, allowing users to perform different real-life operations. Users can use eBank web app to carry out the following fictive operations:

- Log in
- View their total balance
- View their latest transactions and sort them
- View their total money inflows (deposits) and total money outflows (withdrawals)
- Transfer (fictitious) money to another user
- Request a loan
- Close their account

The interface (date format and currency) automatically adjusts depending on the user's location. 

Users are also automatically logged out after a certain moment of inactivity for security reasons.

## User interface

The interface is separated in different parts. 

The current date and account balance are displayed at the top of the screen. The entire financial transactions history is presented on the left of the page, while the elements allowing operations to be carried out are displayed on the right of the page. The summary of deposits and withdrawals is displayed at the bottom, as is the inactivity timer. 

The design of the web app is simple, clear and concise.
  
## Technical aspects

The web app is built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. While certain libraries could have been used to accelerate development, the deliberate choice to utilize only these three technologies was made to thoroughly explore and master various functionalities, features, and methods from JavaScript.

The live version of the eBank web app is [hosted on GitHub gh-pages](https://alexacai.github.io/eBank-web-app/). 

**To enter the web app and simulate operations, use the usernames and PINs below.** Switching from one user to another allows to see transfer operations in action for example.

- Username: jb 
- PIN: 1111

AND

- Username: ew
- PIN: 2222

*Credits: HTML and CSS templates were made available / created by Jonas Schmedtmann.
